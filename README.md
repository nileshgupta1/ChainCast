# ChainCast

The project enables users to add posts that include their username, a post title, post content, and an image. Each post is saved using web3.storage API on IPFS and the CID is kept in a separate array that is also housed on IPFS. The posts are then each individually fetched and displayed on the user interface.


## How it's Made

This is a decentralized post storage and retrieval platform using IPFS and Web3.storage. The front end is a user-friendly interface built using React and Tailwind. The result is a secure and reliable system that offers a seamless user experience. Each post content with its image is stored on some node and its CID is stored which is later used to retrieve the same. 
#### Nobody can change what someone posted removing any centralized control over what is shared.
